    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Metapixel is a program for generating
      <a href="http://www.photomosaic.com/">photomosaics</a>. It can
      generate classical photomosaics, in which the source image is
      viewed as a matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which
      a matching image is substitued, as well as collage-style
      photomosaics, in which rectangular parts of the source image at
      arbitrary positions (i.e. not aligned to a matrix) are
      substituted by matching images.
    </blockquote>

    <h2><a href="examples.html">Examples</a></h2>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Metapixel generates not only classical mosaics but also collage-style
        photomosaics (see <a href="examples.html">examples</a>).

      <li>The matching algorithms match not only color but also form.

      <li>Metapixel is fast. It takes about 75 seconds to generate a classical
        photomosaic for a 2048x2432 image with constituent images of size 64x64
	and a database of slightly more than 11000 images on my not-so-fast
	Alpha. Most of this time is spent loading and saving images.

      <li>Metapixel can generate classical mosaics which contain at
        most one copy of each constituent image.  Alternatively,
        Metapixel can be instructed to honor a minimum distance
        between two occurrences of the same image in classical
        photomosaics.

      <li>Metapixel has a cheat option which overlays the photomosaic
        with the original image using a user-specified
        percentage. Small percentages yield noticable improvements but
        are innocent enough so as not to be noticed without close
        inspection.

      <li>Metapixel is a command-line program and thus scriptable.
    </ul>

      <p><b>02-20-2006</b> Released version 1.0.1.

      <p><b>08-05-2005</b> Released version 1.0.0.

      <blockquote>
        Bugfixes.
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>10-04-2004</b> Released version 0.11.

      <blockquote>
	Metapixel can now take default values for its settings from a
	configuration file in the user's home directory (".metapixelrc").
        The tables files must now always be in the directory where the
	small images reside, and that directory is now called a "library".
	Several bugfixes.
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>09-28-2004</b> Released version 0.10.

      <blockquote>
        Can enforce a minimum image distance for collages.  The prepare
	script can traverse directories recursively (thanks to Jake Di
	Toro).  A rudimentary manual page is included (thanks to Chris
	Vanden Berghe).  Speed improvements for reading the tables file.
	Several other small changes and bugfixes.
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>05-05-2004</b> Released version 0.9.

      <blockquote>
        Fixes a bug that prevented the global search mode to work on
        non-square images.  Adds a utility to sort images by size or
        aspect ratio.  Got rid of libzoom, so Metapixel's license is
        now standard GPL.
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>01-15-2004</b> Released version 0.8.

      <blockquote>
        Introduces a new search method which guarantees that no small
        image is used more than once in a mosaic.  A new feature
        called "antimosaic" has been addes which is probably useless.
        Metapixel can now write the layout of a mosaic to a text file
        and read that file again to reproduce the mosaic.  Compiles on
        MacOS X with Fink.
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>01-21-2000</b> Released version 0.7.

      <blockquote>
        Memory requirements for creating classical photomosaics have
        been lowered tremendously in this version. Also, this version
        features a new option for scaling the input image (thanks to
        Osku Salerma).
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>01-15-2000</b> Released version 0.6. 

      <blockquote>
        This version features a new image matching metric which is
        actually an implementation of a trivial distance metric: the
        constituent image to be compared to and the subimage to be
        compared are both scaled to a size of 5x5 pixels and the sum
        of the distances of their pixels is used as the score, with
        lower scores meaning a better match.
      </blockquote>
